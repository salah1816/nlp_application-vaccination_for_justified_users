# vaccination for justified users using supervised ML
## the model construction procceded as following:
1- clean the dataset

2- Analysing all the null,Nan, missing values in the dataset

3- Preprocess the dataset removing the null values

4- visualize the data and again peprocess the dataset into an umbaised dataset

5- select the input and required output into a dataframe

6- Platform data visualization

7- convert all the objects types into integer types

8- split the train and test data to fit the model

9- create a model

10- Use NLP to preprocess the provided texts

11- predict the verification of the user

## the technical process:
starting with a visualization of our data via wordcloud, heatmap from Seaborn ect..
in order to be able to preprocess the data with the regex and nlp functions of the spacy library,
and then the construction of the model in two ways, with decisionTree from sklearn and Sequential from keras.
